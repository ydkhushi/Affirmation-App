# Affirmation-App

 Affirmations is a simple app that displays ten positive affirmations as text in a scrolling list. 
 Then, in the follow-up codelab, you will take it a step further, add an inspiring image to each affirmation, and polish the app UI.
 
 You will display the text and image for each affirmation within a card, using the MaterialCardView widget from the Material Components for Android library. 
 Then you will finish the app by polishing the UI to create a more cohesive and beautiful user experience.
